# Highlighter
This browser extension saves selected passages of text, or "highlights", while reading in your favorite web browser. The extension saves the highlights to this Rails app: https://github.com/smcalilly/highlighter-rails

No matter what or where you read, your highlights are always available to reference whenever you need them.
