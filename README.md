# highlighter
this browser extension saves "highlights" or selected passages while reading on the internet. the extension sends the highlights to this rails app: https://github.com/smcalilly/highlighter-rails

i recently added jwt authentication system so a user can login and save the highlight from the extension to an account in the rails app. need to change the client authentication to a more secure setup via omniauth.
